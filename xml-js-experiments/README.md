# Converting XML to JavaScript

## Experiments
- going to try [xml2j](shttps://www.npmjs.com/package/xml2js)
  - simple XML, console log what I get
  - complex XML 1 (app XML)
  - complex XML 2 (prototype)

## My notes as I am doing this
- create README for notes (did it the "cool kids" ways `touch README.md`)
- initialize project: `npm init -y`
- install package `npm install xml2js`
- Run experiments!
